        <h1>CLARINET</h1>
        <img src="clarinet1.jpeg">
        <p>The clarinet is a single-reed musical instrument in the woodwind family, with a nearly cylindrical bore and a flared bell.Clarinets comprise a family of instruments of differing sizes and pitches. The clarinet family is the largest woodwind family, ranging from the BB♭ contrabass to the E♭ soprano. The B♭ soprano clarinet is the most common type, and is the instrument usually indicated by the word "clarinet".</p>

            <p>German instrument maker Johann Christoph Denner is generally credited with inventing the clarinet sometime around 1700 by adding a register key to the chalumeau, an earlier single-reed instrument. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability. Today the clarinet is a standard fixture of the orchestra and concert band and is used in classical music, military bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles.</p>

            <p>The word clarinet may have entered the English language via the French clarinette (the feminine diminutive of Old French clarin), or from Provençal clarin ("oboe"),[1] originating from the Latin root clarus ("clear").[2] The word is related to Middle English clarion, a type of trumpet, the name of which derives from the same root.[3]

                The earliest mention of the word clarinette being used for the instrument dates to a 1710 order placed by the Duke of Gronsfeld for two instruments made by Jacob Denner.[4][5] The English form clarinet is found as early as 1733, and the now-archaic clarionet appears from 1784 until the early 20th century.</p>
                <p>A person who plays the clarinet is called a clarinetist (in North American English), a clarinettist (in British English), or simply a clarinet player.</p>
