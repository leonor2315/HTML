        <h1>HARP</h1>
        <p>The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard; the strings are plucked with the fingers. Harps can be made and played in various ways, standing or sitting, and in orchestras or concerts. Its most common form is triangular in shape and made of wood. Some have multiple rows of strings and pedal attachments.</p>
        <p>Ancient depictions of harps were recorded in Mesopotamia (now Iraq), Persia (now Iran) and Egypt, and later in India and China. By medieval times harps had spread across Europe. Harps were found across the Americas where it was a popular folk tradition in some areas. Distinct designs also emerged from the African continent. Harps have symbolic political traditions and are often used in logos, including in Ireland.

            Historically, strings were made of sinew (animal tendons).[2][3] Other materials have included gut (animal intestines),[4] plant fiber,[4] braided hemp,[5] cotton cord,silk,nylon, and wire.</p>
